You can share Dynalist documents and folders privately with other Dynalist users.

#### Adding collaborators

To add a collaborator, enter his or her email in the input box under the "Manage collaborators" section in the popup and choose a permission.

> Note: make sure you know which email your collaborator used to sign up. An error will appear if the email you entered is not found in our database.

#### Removing collaborators

To remove a collaborate, click on the Ã— icon at the right end of each collaborator row.

#### What does these permission mean?

"View only" and "Can edit" are straightforward. "Manage" permission allows the collaborator the manage the sharing options, which means he or she can add more collaborators or kick out existing ones.

The owner, which is the person who owns the file, is a special permission that cannot be assigned. Collaborators with "Manage" permission cannot kick out the owner.
