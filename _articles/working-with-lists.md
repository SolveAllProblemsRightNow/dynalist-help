#### Opening list menu

To see a list of all applicable actions, use the item menu. When you mouseover an item, a hamburger icon will show up in front of it. Click on it to open the menu. Alternatively, you can right click on the bullet point to achieve the same thing.

#### Change multiple lists at once

You can drag to select multiple items just like how you can drag to select multiple lines in a word processor. From there, the instructions below will work for multiple items as well. The item menu will also show actions applicable to the current selected items.

## Making changes

#### Moving lists

To move a list, simply drag it by the bullet point and move it around. While dragging, you will see a grey line at the location it's going to be moved to after you release the mouse.

#### Deleting lists

The fastest way to delete a list is to use the shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+Enter`. If your right hand is on the mouse, this can be a little hard to press — use `Ctrl+X` instead.

Alternatively, you can choose "Delete" in the item menu.

#### Adding notes

Notes are extra, secondary information you can add to an item. You can jump between the main item and its note field with `Shift+Enter`.

## Copying & exporting

#### Copying lists

To copy a list, move it while holding `Ctrl`. This should sound familiar to some people as this is also how you copy files on both Windows and Mac.

#### Exporting lists

To export a list, open the item menu and choose "Export...". For more information on exporting, see [the export section](../export/).

## Converting lists

#### Converting lists to checklists

Please see ["Creating checklists"](../list-types/#creating-checklists).

#### Converting lists to numbered lists

Please see ["Creating numbered lists"](../list-types/#creating-numbered-lists).

#### Converting lists to standalone documents

To convert a list to a document, simply drag it to the file pane on the left.

> Known bug: dragging to the empty space at the bottom doesn't work right now — drop it among existing files instead.
