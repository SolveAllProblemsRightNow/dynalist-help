We treat your privacy seriously.

#### Who can see my documents?

Only you and people who you explicitly shared files with. All files are private by default.

#### But you guys can read my stuff, right?

Technically we are able to, but no one at Dynalist will ever look at the content of your documents without your explicit permission. Sometimes we will look at log files or metadata for your account, documents, or folders, in order to debug issues with your account or with Dynalist.

For more information, you can read [our privacy policy](https://dynalist.io/privacy).
