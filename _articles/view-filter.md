In Dynalist, you can choose to hide things that you don't need to see at the moment.

#### Check items

In the top right corner of the document, there's an eye icon. Upon clicking on it, you can see two sections. The top section indicates the current filter state of checked items.

You can choose to either show or hide checked items. They are shown by default.

#### Notes

You can toggle visibility of notes similarly to how you toggle checked items.

The difference is that there are three options instead of two: you can show notes, only show the first line, or hide them. The notes are shown in its entirety by default.
