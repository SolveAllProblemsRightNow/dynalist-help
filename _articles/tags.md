To categorize your items, use tags like `#work` or `@dave`. Clicking on a tag will show everything with the same tag.

When typing tags, an suggestion popup will appear to help you write tags faster. These suggestions are generated on a per document basis.

> Note: there has to be a space before the `#` or `@`, unless if it's the first thing in the item.

#### Removing a tag

To quickly remove a tag, holding down `Alt` and click on it.
