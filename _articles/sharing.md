You can share your stuff with others no matter if they have a Dynalist account or not.

#### Enable sharing

In the file pane, right click on a folder or a document and choose "Manage sharing...". A popup will appear to confirm that you want to start sharing this file. Click on the "Share this document" or "Share this folder" button.

After you start sharing a file, you have the option to publicly or privately share it (see below).

> Note: Dynalist does not support nested sharing, which means that if file A is shared, you cannot share any file that contains file A or is inside file A.

#### Stop sharing

In the sharing popup, click on the "Unshare this document" or "Unshare this folder". A confirmation popup will appear, as this is a destructive action. Unsharing will clear all collaborator information.

#### How do I know if a file is being shared?

Shared files' icons are blue, whereas unshared files' icons are dark grey.
