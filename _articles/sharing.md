You can share your stuff with others no matter if they have a Dynalist account or not.

## General

#### Enable sharing

In the file pane, right click on a folder or a document and choose "Manage sharing...". A popup will appear to confirm that you want to start sharing this file. Click on the "Share this document" or "Share this folder" button.

After you start sharing a file, you have the option to publicly or privately share it (see below).

> Note: Dynalist does not support nested sharing, which means that if file A is shared, you cannot share any file that contains file A or is inside file A.

#### Stop sharing

In the sharing popup, click on the "Unshare this document" or "Unshare this folder". A confirmation popup will appear, as this is a destructive action. Unsharing will clear all collaborator information.

#### How do I know if a file is being shared?

Shared files' icons are blue, whereas unshared files' icons are dark grey.

## Public sharing via link

Public sharing allows anyone with link to access the document.

> Note: folders cannot be shared this way.

#### Enabling public sharing

Check the "View this document" checkbox to enable sharing. This allows other people to access your document using the link above. This action **does not** give them edit permission.

#### Giving out edit permission

Check the "Edit this document" checkbox to allow others to edit your document.

> Note: please only send the link to people you absolutely trust if you turn on this option. Backing up your data before sharing is also a wise thing to do.


## Sharing with other Dynalist users

#### Adding collaborators

To add a collaborator, enter his or her email in the input box under the "Manage collaborators" section in the popup and choose a permission.

> Note: make sure you know which email your collaborator used to sign up. An error will appear if the email you entered is not found in our database.

#### Removing collaborators

To remove a collaborate, click on the Ã— icon at the right end of each collaborator row.

#### What does these permission mean?

"View only" and "Can edit" are straightforward. "Manage" permission allows the collaborator the manage the sharing options, which means he or she can add more collaborators or kick out existing ones.

The owner, which is the person who owns the file, is a special permission that cannot be assigned. Collaborators with "Manage" permission cannot kick out the owner.
