## Numbered lists

Numbered list items have a number before it rather than a bullet point. Like in other word processors, the numbers are dynamically adjusted as you add and remove items.

#### Creating numbered lists

To convert a list into a numbered list, open the item menu and select "Make numbered list". You can also press `Ctrl+Alt+N` when focusing on an item.

> Note: making an item a numbered list does not append a number before itself; the effect is applied to its children.
