#### Creating a new list

Creating a new list is just like creating a new line in a text editor. After putting the cursor at the end of a list item, hit `Enter` to make a new line after it.

You can also split an item into two parts by hitting `Enter` while the cursor is in the middle of it.

#### Adding children to a list

A list's children are also called sublists. When you create a new item with `Enter`, it will be on the same level as the previous one. Now to make it a child of the previous item, press `Tab`.

#### Promoting a child

The opposite of `Tab` is `Shift+Tab`. It "pulls out" the item by one level â€” useful for starting another list.
