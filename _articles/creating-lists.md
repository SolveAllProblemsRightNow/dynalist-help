Here are the basics on how to work with lists.

#### Creating a new list

Creating a new list is like creating a new line in a text editor. After you have put your caret focus at the end of a list item, you can hit `Enter` to make a new line after it.

You can also split a list item into two by hitting `Enter` while the caret is in the middle of it.

#### Adding children to a list

A list's children are also called sublists. When you create a new item using `Enter`, it will be sit on the same level as the previous one. Now to make it a child of the previous item, press `Tab`.

#### "Promoting" a child

The opposite of `Tab` is `Shift+Tab`. It "pulls out" the item by one level â€” useful for starting another list.
