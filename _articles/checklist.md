Checklist items have a checkbox in front of them, making it easy to check them off. It also makes it more obvious that an item is an actionable task.

> Note: you don't have to make an item a checklist in order to check it off â€” you can check off anything.

#### Creating checklists

To convert a list into a checklist, open the item menu and select "Make checklist". You can also press `Ctrl+Alt+C` when focusing on an item.

#### Checking things off

For items with checkboxes, simply click on the checkbox to check them off. The keyboard shortcut is `Ctrl+Enter` while focusing on the item. You can also check off items by choosing the "Check off" option in the item menu.

Unchecking a checked items works the same way.
