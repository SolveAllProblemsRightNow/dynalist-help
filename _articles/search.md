#### Tagging

To categorize your items, use tags like `#work` or `@dave`. Clicking on a tag will show everything with the same tag.

When typing tags, an suggestion popup will appear to help you write tags faster. These suggestions are generated on a per document basis.

> Note: there has to be a space before the `#` or `@`, unless if it's the first thing in the item.

#### Search within document or list

Above the document title on the right side, there's a üîç icon. Clicking on it will activate the search bar. Typing anything in the search bar will filter results in real time. The shortcut to activate the search bar is `Ctrl+F`.

#### Search everywhere

Sometimes you want to search across all your documents. To do this, first activate the normal search by clicking the üîç icon or hitting `Ctrl+F`. After entering the search query, clicking on the "Search everywhere" link underneath the search bar. The shortcut for this is `Ctrl+Enter` while focusing in the search bar.

#### Saving common searches

To save a commonly performed search, refer to the [bookmark section](../bookmarks/#bookmarking-search-results).

#### Find files

To find a file, press `Ctrl+O` ("O" for "open") to bring up the file finder. A search interface will pop up. Files are filtered in real time as you type. You can use `Up` and `Down` to navigate the results and use `Enter` to go to a result.

An alternative way to open the file finder is to click on the üîç icon in the header bar of the file pane on the left. Although we would strongly encourage you to use keyboard shortcut for this, as you can switch to a different file without leaving the keyboard.

#### Advanced search operators

When search for `apple pie`, any item that contains both `apple` and `pie` will be matched. If you want to search for an exact keyword and not anything else, surround the search term with double quotes like so: `"apple pie"`.

If you want to find all items that contains either `apple` or `pie`, search for `apple OR pie`.

If you want to find all items that don't contain `apple`, search for `-apple`.

You can combine these operators as you like.
