If you're using a keyboard layout that's not English, default shortcuts may interfere with your normal usage such like typing a certain character in your language. For this consideration, we've changed some shortcuts for the following keyboard layouts.

You'll need to change your "Keyboard layout" setting in Settings → Preferences → Input for this to work.

#### French

Set heading 3: `Ctrl+Alt+3` → `Shift+Alt+3`

Clear heading:  `Ctrl+Alt+0` → `Shift+Alt+0`

#### Polish

Toggle checklist: `Ctrl+Alt+C` → `Shift+Alt+C`

Toggle numbered list: `Ctrl+Alt+N` → `Shift+Alt+N`

Toggle visibility of checked items: `Alt+C` → `Ctrl+Shift+Alt+C`

Toggle visibility of notes: `Alt+N` → `Ctrl+Shift+Alt+N`

### German

Zoom in: `Ctrl+]` → `Alt+Right`

Zoom out: `Ctrl+[` → `Alt+Left`

### Czech

Set heading 2: `Ctrl+Alt+2` → `Shift+Alt+2`

Set heading 3: `Ctrl+Alt+3` → `Shift+Alt+3`
