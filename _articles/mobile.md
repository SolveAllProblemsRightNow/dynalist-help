Using Dynalist on mobile is similar to how it works on desktop, with a few key differences which we'll explain in detail below.

#### Toolbar menu

Since keyboard shortcuts are not available on mobile, editing is done using the toolbar menu. The toolbar menu will appear when you focus on a list.

On Android, the toolbar will appear at the bottom of the page, above the on-screen keyboard, whereas on iOS it will appear above the item being edited.

Using the toolbar menu, you can do these common actions:

1. Indent/unindent;
2. Move item up/down;
3. Expand/collapse;
4. Zoom in;
5. Delete;
6. Add note;
7. Check off item;
8. Make heading (Android only);
9. Making checklist (Android only);
10. Get link (Android only).

#### Left pane

The left pane can be accessed by clicking on the hamburger menu at the top left corner.

There are two tabs in the mobile left pane: files and bookmarks. At the top of each tab, there are buttons for common actions such like creating new document, creating new folder, find files, or bookmark current state.

#### Adding Dynalist to your home screen

On both Android and iOS, you can add a website to your home screen. This will improve the experience by hiding the address bar. It also makes using Dynalist more convenient.

#### When will mobile apps be available?

Soon! We're finishing off offline mode as of end of July, which is a prerequisite of mobile and desktop apps. Stay tuned!
