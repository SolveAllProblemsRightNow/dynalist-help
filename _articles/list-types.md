There are three types of lists in Dynalist:

1. Normal lists;
2. Checklists;
3. Numbered lists.

### Checklists

Checklist items have a checkbox in front of them, making it easy to check off. It also makes it more obvious that an item is a task rather than random information.

> Note: you don't have to make an item a checklist in order to check it off â€” you can check off anything.

#### Creating checklists

To convert a list into a checklist, open the item menu and select "Make checklist". You can also press `Ctrl+Alt+C` when focusing on an item.

#### Checking things off

For checkbox items, simply click on the checkbox to check it off. The keyboard shortcut is `Ctrl+Enter` while focusing on the item. You can also check it off by choosing the "Check off" option in the item menu.

Unchecking a checked items works the same way.


### Numbered lists

Numbered list items have a number before it rather than a bullet point. Like in other word processors, the numbers are dynamically adjusted as you add and remove items.

#### Creating numbered lists

To convert a list into a numbered list, open the item menu and select "Make numbered list". You can also press `Ctrl+Alt+N` when focusing on an item.

> Note: making an item a numbered list does not append a number before itself; the effect is applied to its children.
