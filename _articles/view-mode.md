In Dynalist, you can choose to hide things that you don't need to see at the moment.

#### Check items

In the top right corner of the document, there's an eye icon. Upon clicking on it, two icons will show up. Click on the check mark icon to toggle the visibility of checked items.

The blue check mark icon means that checked items are currently visible, while the grey check mark icon means that they're hidden.

#### Notes

You can toggle visibility of notes similarly to how you toggle checked items, except that you click on the note icon rather than the check mark icon.

The difference is that there are three options instead of two: you can show notes, only show the first line, or hide them.

#### Left pane

When you don't need to see your files or bookmarks, you can collapse the left pane. The option can be found on the header bar.

Alternatively, you can close the current showing pane via shortcuts. Use `Ctrl+Shift+F` to collapse the file pane and `Ctrl+Shift+B` to collapse the bookmark pane.

The left pane is also resizable â€” simply drag its right border to resize.
