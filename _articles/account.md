#### I can't receive my confirmation email!

First of all, check your spam folder. Our emails sometimes end up in spam folders for unknown reasons, which is sad.

If it's not in the spam folder and you haven't closed the sign up page, the success message has your email information in it. Double check your email â€” it's common to make a typo in the email.

If nothing above works, [contact us]({{ site.feedback_url }}) for help.

#### Forgot password

You can request to reset your password [here](https://dynalist.io/forgot). An email will be sent to the email address you used to sign up. In there you'll find a link to reset your password.

#### Change password

Click on the gear icon at the top right corner to open settings. Under the "Account" tab, you can change your password. Confirm your old password and enter your new password twice and you're good to go!

#### Change your email address

There's no way to change your email address by yourself right now. [Shoot us a note]({{ site.feedback_url }}) and we'll do it for you.

#### Delete your account

Like changing your email address, there's no way to do this yourself. You can delete all the content, which is pretty close to having you account deleted.

If you really insist on deleting your account, [let us know]({{ site.feedback_url }}) and we'll do it for you.
