Public sharing allows anyone with link to access the document.

> Note: folders cannot be shared this way.

#### Enabling public sharing

Check the "View this document" checkbox to enable sharing. This allows other people to access your document using the link above. This action **does not** give them edit permission.

#### Giving out edit permission

Check the "Edit this document" checkbox to allow others to edit your document.

> Note: please only send the link to people you absolutely trust if you turn on this option. Backing up your data before sharing is also a wise thing to do.
