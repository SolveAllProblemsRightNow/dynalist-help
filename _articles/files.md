Document and folder are two types of files in Dynalist. You can think of each document as a "root" list that you can expand on. Folders can contain other files, making it useful when organizing your workspace.

#### Creating files

In the file pane on the left, you can open the create file menu by right clicking anywhere inside the pane or clicking on the "+" icon in the header bar of the icon. In the menu, you can choose to create a document or a folder. This way the new file in created in the **root** level in your Dynalist.

To create a file inside a specific folder, right click on the folder to find the options to create file under it.

#### Opening documents

To open a document, simply click on its title. There's no need to double click it like in your file system, as that will start renaming the document.

A faster way to open documents is to use the [file finder](../search/#find-files).

#### Collapsing/expanding folders

Folders can be collapsed if you don't need to see what's inside for now. Click on the little triangle arrow icon in front of each folder to collapse or expand it.

#### Renaming files

To rename a file, you can either double click on its title or right click on a file and select "Rename".

#### Moving files

To move a file, drag it to the new destination.

> Note: it can be tricky to move a file into an empty folder. It's easy to end up moving the file below the empty folder. In that case, drag it upwards by a tiny bit should work.

#### Deleting files

To delete a file, right click on it and choose "Delete". A deletion confirmation popup will appear.

#### Copying documents

Sometimes you may have a document that you use as a template for other documents. In that case, you can make a clone of it by right clicking on it and choosing "Make a copy". Dynalist will prompt you to name the new copy.
