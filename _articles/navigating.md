#### Switching documents

To switch another document, simply [open another document](../files/#opening-documents). The newly opened document will appear, replacing the currently open document.

If you don't want to leave the keyboard, use the [file finder](../search/#find-files) to switch between documents.

Switching to another bookmark works in the same way.

#### Changing list zoom

Zooming into a list will show what's inside that list only. The zoomed in list becomes the new "root list". This is ideal if you want to focus on something for now.

To zoom in, click on the magnifying glass icon that appear next to the hamburger menu when you mouseover an item. Or you can choose "Zoom in" in the item menu. The shortcut for this is `Ctrl+]`.

To zoom out, click on any list title in the breadcrumb above the document title. Alternatively, you can use the shortcut `Ctrl+[` to zoom out by one level.

#### Link to another list

Another way to navigate is to follow internal links. Internal links will have an infinity symbol in front of the link. They also look visually different from the normal links.

See [the working with lists section](../working-with-lists/#linking-to-other-lists) to see how to quickly link to another item.
